# Python Sprint - DNA Sequence
#### Jesse Boise - 11/05/2020

The goal of this project is to create a program that simulates a die roll.
The project is built to meet the following criteria:
1. Once the program has begun running, it will randomly select a number between a certain range - default is 6, inclusive.
2. The program will then output the determined value and ask the user if he or she would like to roll again.

## Requirements
This program has no requirements other than Python 3 and a need to simulate a dice roll.

## Usage
### For standalone / testing purposes
Simply run the following command from the command-line / terminal:
<pre>python3 main.py</pre>

### For module / package use
At present Spicy Dicy is not built with modularity in mind, if you would like these features to be applied, open up an issue with GitHub's issue tracker at
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JesseBoise/pydna_modifier/issues) and I will take a look at it.
