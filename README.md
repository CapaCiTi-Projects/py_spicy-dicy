# Python Sprint - DNA Sequence
#### Jesse Boise - 4/05/2020

This program can be used to perform two functions, namely:
* Transform a codon sequence into it's Amino Acid SLC equivalent.
* Read the file 'DNA.txt' and mutate its contents into two other files:
  * a file called 'normalDNA.txt' that has all of its 'a' chars converted to 'A'.
  * a file called 'mutatedDNA.txt' that has all of its 'a' chars converted to 'T'.
* Take the files outputed from mutate ('normalDNA.txt' & 'mutatedDNA.txt') and run transform on them to retrieve their Amino Acid SLCs.

## Requirements
This program has no requirements other than Python 3 and knowledge of DNA.

Before running, a text file named 'DNA.txt' is required to perform the mutate function

## Usage
### For standalone / testing purposes
Simply run the following command from the command-line / terminal:
<pre>python3 main.py</pre>

### For module / package use
At present Spicy Dicy is not built with modularity in mind, if you would like these features to be applied, open up an issue with GitHub's issue tracker at
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JesseBoise/pydna_modifier/issues) and I will take a look at it.
